This Repository is for anyone who are interested in learning Statistics and
Probability using Python. This Repo is the Python version of [Stanford Online
Course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:OLI+ProbStat+Open_Jan2017/about)
which uses excel, R and other statistical tools but not Python.

The work is still on progress. I will keep adding new course contents as I
finishes it. If you are new to python then please download the [Anaconda Python
Distribution] which by default install almost all the libraries you need for
Data science.
